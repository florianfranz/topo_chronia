  abstract = {Paleogeographic maps play a central integrating role across all the disciplines of the Earth System Sciences. They increasingly serve as boundary conditions for climate, earth, and life models and are widely used to convey our understanding of the Earth System's evolution. We review methods and data used for making paleogeographic reconstructions that provide a background for using Terra Antiqua, a user-friendly interface software for a broader community of users and applications. The review also clarifies the context that led to the development of this new software for paleogeographic reconstructions that combines the power of GPlates, a tectonic reconstruction software, and QGIS, a leading open-source GIS software, to make the reconstruction process easy, flexible, intuitive, and fast with a set of innovative tools. Being developed as a plugin for QGIS, Terra Antiqua makes use of the QGIS Python API, providing users with advanced geospatial data processing algorithms coupled with an intuitive graphical user interface. It has a modular structure, breaking the whole reconstruction process into small steps and providing users with flexibility in their reconstructions. Terra Antiqua comes with detailed user guidelines, manuals, and video tutorials on www.paleoenvironment.eu/terra-antiqua. The current limitations and potential developments of Terra Antiqua are discussed, including, amongst others, the estimation and mapping uncertainties, generating more realistic geomorphic features, and the integration of databases in a web application.},

  abstract = {Reconstructing the 3D structure of the Earth's mantle has been a challenge for geodynamicists for about 40 yr. Although numerical models and computational capabilities have substantially progressed, parameterizations used for modeling convection forced by plate motions are far from being Earth-like. Among the set of parameters, rheology is fundamental because it defines in a non-linear way the dynamics of slabs and plumes, and the organization of lithosphere deformation. In this study, we evaluate the role of the temperature dependence of viscosity (variations up to 6 orders of magnitude) and the importance of pseudo-plasticity on reconstructing slab evolution in 3D spherical models of convection driven by plate history models. Pseudo-plasticity, which produces plate-like behavior in convection models, allows a consistent coupling between imposed plate motions and global convection, which is not possible with temperature-dependent viscosity alone. Using test case models, we show that increasing temperature dependence of viscosity enhances vertical and lateral coherence of slabs, but leads to unrealistic slab morphologies for large viscosity contrasts. Introducing pseudo-plasticity partially solves this issue, producing thin laterally and vertically more continuous slabs, and flat subduction where trench retreat is fast. We evaluate the differences between convection reconstructions employing different viscosity laws to be very large, and similar to the differences between two models with the same rheology but using two different plate histories or initial conditions.},

  abstract = {We present a new algorithm for modeling a self-consistent set of global plate polygons. Each plate polygon is composed of a finite list of plate margins, all with different Euler poles. We introduce a ’’continuously closed plate’’ (CCP), such that, as each margin moves independently, the plate polygon remains closed geometrically as a function of time. This method solves emerging needs in computational geodynamics to combine kinematic with dynamic models. Because they have polygons that are too widely spaced in time and have inconsistent motions between margins and plates, traditional global plate tectonic reconstructions have become inadequate for geodynamics. The CCP algorithm has been incorporated into the GPlates open-source paleogeographic system. The algorithm is a set of procedures and data structures that operate on collections of reconstructed geometric data to form closed plate polygons; the main data structures used for each plate polygon are based on a nested hierarchy of topological elements. Reconstructions with CCPs can be created, edited, visualized, and exported with GPlates. The native storage of the dynamic reconstructions is the GPlates Markup Language, GPML, which uses an XML-based file format called GML. We demonstrate the utility of the CCP method by creating a global reconstruction with continuously closing plates from 140 Ma to the present using data from existing, traditional reconstructions.},

  abstract = {Depositional stratigraphy represents the only physical archive of palaeo-sediment routing and this limits analysis of ancient source-to-sink systems in both space and time. Here, we use palaeo-digital elevation models (palaeoDEMs; based on high-resolution palaeogeographic reconstructions), HadCM3L general circulation model climate data and the BQART suspended sediment discharge model to demonstrate a predictive, forward approach to palaeo-sediment routing system analysis. To exemplify our approach, we use palaeoDEMs and HadCM3L data to predict the configurations, geometries and climates of large continental catchments in the Cenomanian and Turonian North American continent. Then, we use BQART to estimate suspended sediment discharges and catchment-averaged erosion rates and we map their spatial distributions. We validate our estimates with published geologic constraints from the Cenomanian Dunvegan Formation, Alberta, Canada, and the Turonian Ferron Sandstone, Utah, USA, and find that estimates are consistent or within a factor of two to three. We then evaluate the univariate and multivariate sensitivity of our estimates to a range of uncertainty margins on palaeogeographic and palaeoclimatic boundary conditions; large uncertainty margins (≤50\%/±5°C) still recover estimates of suspended sediment discharge within an order of magnitude of published constraints. PalaeoDEMs are therefore suitable as a first-order investigative tool in palaeo-sediment routing system analysis and are particularly useful where stratigraphic records are incomplete. We highlight the potential of this approach to predict the global spatio-temporal response of suspended sediment discharges and catchment-averaged erosion rates to long-period tectonic and climatic forcing in the geologic past.},

  abstract = {On multimillion-year time scales, Earth has experienced warm ice-free and cold glacial climates, but it is unknown whether transitions between these background climate states were the result of changes in carbon dioxide sources or sinks. Low-latitude arc-continent collisions are hypothesized to drive cooling by exhuming and eroding mafic and ultramafic rocks in the warm, wet tropics, thereby increasing Earth’s potential to sequester carbon through chemical weathering. To better constrain global weatherability through time, the paleogeographic position of all major Phanerozoic arc-continent collisions was reconstructed and compared to the latitudinal distribution of ice sheets. This analysis reveals a strong correlation between the extent of glaciation and arc-continent collisions in the tropics. Earth’s climate state is set primarily by global weatherability, which changes with the latitudinal distribution of arc-continent collisions.},

Deep incision and recent denudation of these mountain ranges, abundant late Cenozoic coarse sediment near them, and palaeobotanical evidence for warmer climates, where high mountain climates today are relatively cold, have traditionally been interpreted as evidence for recent uplift. An alternative cause of these phenomena is late Cenozoic global climate change: towards lower temperatures, increased alpine glaciation, a stormier climate, and perturbations to humidity, vegetative cover and precipitation.},

On the other hand, climate is a nonlinear system with a multitude of feedback mechanisms, which compete and balance in a different way that depends on the initial and boundary conditions, opening the possibility, in numerical experiments, to obtain multiple steady states under the same forcing. Here, we use the MITgcm with a coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea ice-land configuration to explore the existence of such alternative steady states around the Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB). We construct the corresponding bifurcation diagram accounting for processes on a timescale of thousands of years, in order to identify the stability range of the steady states and tipping points in regard to atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} content. We find three alternative steady states with a difference in global mean surface air temperature of around 10 \&deg;C. We also investigate how these climatic steady states are modified when feedbacks acting over comparable or longer time scales are included, in particular vegetation dynamics and air-sea carbon exchange. Our findings for multistability provide a useful framework for explaining climatic variations observed in Early Triassic geological records, and some discrepancies between numerical simulations in the literature and geological data at the PTB and its aftermaths.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Paleogeography is the study of the changing surface of Earth through time. Driven by plate tectonics, the configuration of the continents and ocean basins has been in constant flux. Plate tectonics pushes the land surface upward or pulls it apart, causing its collapse. All the while, the unrelenting forces of climate and weather slowly reduce mountains to sand and mud and redistribute these sediments to the sea. This article reviews the changing paleogeography of the past 750 million years. It describes the broad patterns of Phanerozoic paleogeography as well as many of the specific paleogeographic events that have shaped the modern continents and ocean basins. The focus is on the changing latitudinal distribution of the continents, fluctuations in sea level, the opening and closing of oceanic seaways, mountain building, and how these paleogeographic changes have affected global climate, ocean circulation, and the evolution of life. This review presents an atlas of 114 paleogeographic maps that illustrate how Earth\&apos;s surface has evolved during the past 750 million years. During that time interval, Earth has witnessed the formation and breakup of two supercontinents: Pannotia and Pangea. The continents have been transformed from low-lying flooded platforms to high-standing land areas crisscrossed by the scars of past continental collisions. Oceans have opened and closed, and then opened again in a seemingly never-ending cycle. ▪ The changing configuration of the continents and ocean basins during the past 750 million years is illustrated in 114 paleogeographic maps. ▪ These maps describe how the surface of Earth has been continually modified by mountain building and erosion. ▪ The changing paleogeography has affected global climate, ocean circulation, and the evolution of life. ▪ The data and methods used to produce the maps are described in detail.},

Although the synthetic topography may be viewed as relatively crude, it has the advantage of being applicable anywhere on the globe and at any geological time. The model allows estimating the sea-level changes throughout the Phanerozoic, with the possibility, for the first time, to flood accordingly continental areas. One of the most striking results is the good correlation with “measured” sea-level changes, implying that long-term variations are predominantly tectonically-driven. Volumes of mountain relief are also estimated through time and compared with strontium isotopic ratio (Sr-ratio), commonly thought to reflect mountain belt erosion. The tectonic impact upon the general Sr-ratio trend is shown herein for the first time, although such influence was long been inferred.},

  abstract = {Palaeogeographic reconstructions have been proposed for years. The technique employed, however, is more or less always the same: it consists of determining the palaeoenvironment at the local scale and extending it to the regional scale. Such work is carried out in a maximum number of locations all over the planet and the global palaeogeography is the result of interpolation of those reconstructions. Advances in palaeogeography can be made via an alternative way, which consists of integrating and then coupling various global models. It results in the proposal of synthetic palaeogeographies that can be compared a posteriori to local or regional data. The advantage is twofold: (1) the view is really global and it avoids gaps (in particular in the oceanic realm) in the reconstructions, and it is very much less focused on the coastline; (2) it takes advantages from almost all the fields of geosciences, so that reconstructions can be constrained from a large variety of data. The two techniques – the ‘classic’ and the ‘alternative’ – are not contradictory but complementary, and it is desirable that one feeds the other and the study of palaeogeography be revived.},
